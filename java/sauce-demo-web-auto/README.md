 # Execution

 Once the prerequirements are met, the commands must be run from the same directory as this README.md file. To start the execution environment, use the following Docker command:

`docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up selenium-hub chrome`

After the environment has been started, run the tests with the following Maven command:

`mvn clean test`

To perform a multi-thread execution of test scenarios, use the Maven command bellow:

`mvn -T 4 clean test`

Where `4` is a number of threads used during execution.

If you want to run only a specific feature or test scenario, use tags as shown in the example below:

`mvn clean test -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@login"`

The result of all test runs can be accessed at `./target/cucumber/report.html`.
